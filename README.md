# hyperdb-questions

Sample repo connecting the [hyperdb](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb) to a [discovery-swarm](https://github.com/mafintosh/discovery-swarm) for the purpose of asking a few questions.  
Derived from [@cblgh's](https://github.com/cblgh) super helpful [example](https://github.com/cblgh/hyperdb-examples).

---

Also, HUGE gratitude and thanks to @mafintosh, and everyone else contributing, for creating these building blocks. What a treasure trove of extraordinary work.

## Example

    npm install # yada yada yada

Open `1..n` console running:

    npm start

They each create a new hyperdb, using the initial database's `dbKey` based on input taken into the console.

The demo simpley writes arbitray values to the primary database on a loop (`db-1`). Subsequence windows (`db-2`...etc) listen and log the changes.

To delete the databases and start again:

    npm run clean

## Questions

I have a few orienting questions as I get my hands dirty with some code. I've posted each question as an [issue](https://github.com/philcockfield/hyperdb-questions/issues) to allow comments/discussion there.

- [ ] DiscoveryKey
- [ ] Swarm (latest approach?) and “Hole Punching”? (firewalls etc)
- [ ] Map/Reduce (when are these invoked, and how are they used by a consuming app?)
