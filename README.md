# hyperdb-questions

Sample repo connecting the [hyperdb](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb) to a [discovery-swarm](https://github.com/mafintosh/discovery-swarm) for the purpose of asking a few questions.  
Derived from [@cblgh's](https://github.com/cblgh) super helpful [example](https://github.com/cblgh/hyperdb-examples).

Also, HUGE gratitude and thanks to [@mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh) (and everyone else contributing) for creating these building blocks. What a treasure trove of extraordinary work.

## Questions

I have a few orienting questions as I start getting my hands dirty with some code.  
I've posted each question as an [issue](https://github.com/philcockfield/hyperdb-questions/issues) to allow easy comments and discussion there for anyone who can weigh in (thanks!).

- [ ] [Question #1](https://github.com/philcockfield/hyperdb-questions/issues/1): Using the Discovery Key
- [ ] [Question #2](https://github.com/philcockfield/hyperdb-questions/issues/2): Swarm Setup (latest approach?)
- [ ] [Question #3](https://github.com/philcockfield/hyperdb-questions/issues/3): Map and Reduce usage in HyperDB options

## Example Code

```bash
npm install # yada yada yada
```

Open `1..n` consoles running:

    npm start

Each console creates a new [hyperdb](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdb), using the initial database's `dbKey`.

The demo simply writes arbitray values to the primary database on a loop (`db-1`). Subsequence windows (`db-2`...etc) listen and log the changes.

To delete the databases and start again:

    npm run reset
